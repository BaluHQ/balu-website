            <h4>Page Searches</h4>
            <p>The basic function of Balu is to search the website you're on for matching products and, if found, provide alternative
               recommendations. That means the app searches the text of the page you're on.</p>
            <p>However, Balu only searches "active" websites (you can see the active websites on your options screen). That means, for
               every other website, Balu is doing nothing. It checks to see if the URL you've just navigated to matches one of its active
               websites and, if it doesn't, it immediately goes back to sleep. It doesn't log anything, it doesn't search the page. Nothing.</p>
            <p>Balu does not operate in incognito mode unless you tell it to.</p>
            <p>The active websites are just the retail websites that we've configured Balu to work on. We'll be adding to this list all the
               time, so keep checking back, but we will only ever add sensible retail websites. We will NOT add a generic search engine
               (like Google) without asking you first.</p>
            <hr>
            <h4>Logging</h4>
            <p>We keep track of the webpages that trigger Balu to make recommendations to you, what recommendations you see, and whether you
                click-through and buy these recommendations. We do this so that, as Balu grows, we can send a message to corporations
                that ethical business practice pays off. But this is all aggregated reporting - it will never, EVER be linked to you and
                your personal details in any way.</p>
            <p>Balu also presents a rare opportunity to analyse ethical consumerism without some of the bias inherent in all existing academic
                studies. This exciting new data, we hope, will drive new research and prove vital in helping motivate companies to cater more to the ethical
                consumer. We are open and honest about the logs Balu keeps because we believe we are keeping useful data for benificial reasons.</p>
            <p>But if you're at all worried about any of this, just get in touch and we can discuss it further.</p>
            <hr>
            <h4>Last Word</h4>
            <p>We have created Balu to help make the world a better place. We have no interest in your personal shopping habits, only in the
                aggregated shopping habits of the entire Balu user community.</p>
            <hr>
            <h4>Deleting your account</h4>
            <p>If you want to stop using your account you can simply stop using it. If you would like all your personal data to be deleted,
            please email us at <a href="mailto:info@getbalu.org">info@getbalu.org</a> and we will do it for you and confirm when complete.</p>
