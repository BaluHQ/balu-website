            <h4>What Does Balu Do?</h4>
            <p>The basic function of Balu is to search the website you're on for matching products and, if found, provide alternative
               recommendations. That means the app searches the text of your webpage.</p>
            <p>Balu only searches "active" websites (you can see the active websites on your options screen). That means, for
               every other website, Balu is doing nothing. It checks to see if the URL you've just navigated to matches one of its active
               websites and, if it does not, it immediately goes back to sleep. It doesn't log anything, it doesn't search the page. Nothing.</p>
            <p>And Balu does not operate in incognito mode unless you tell it to.</p>
            <p>These "active" websites are the retail websites that we've configured Balu to work on. We'll be adding to this list all the
               time, so keep checking back, but we will only ever add sensible retail websites. We will NOT add a generic search engine
               (like Google) without asking you first.</p>
            <hr>
            <h4>Logging</h4>
            <p>We want to send a message to corporations that ethical business pays off. To do this, Balu needs to gather as
               much data as possible - without infringing your anonymity. To do this, Balu tracks the following:</p>
               <ul>
                   <li>The webpages that trigger Balu to make its recommendation</li>
                   <li>What recommendations are displayed</li>
                   <li>What recommendations are clicked on</li>
               </ul>
            <p>Personal data, like the webpages you visit, is always logged anonymously.</p>
            <p>Our code is open source</p>
            <hr>
            <h4>Last Word</h4>
            <p>We have created Balu to help make the world a better place. We have no interest in your personal shopping habits, only in the
               aggregated shopping habits of the entire Balu user community.</p>
            <hr>
            <h4>Deleting your account</h4>
            <p>If you want to stop using your account you can simply stop using it. If you would like all your personal data to be deleted,
            please email us at <a href="mailto:support@getbalu.org">support@getbalu.org</a> and we will do it for you.</p>
