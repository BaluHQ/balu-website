            <h4>1. How do you decide what's ethical?</h4>
            <p>This is the big one. If there was a simple answer to this there would probably be a lot less suffering and environmental destruction in the world.
               There are many great organisations out there who research companies and products and grade their ethicality. It's a huge, never-ending task, and it's
               very hard to do well. That is not what Balu is about.</p>
            <p>Instead, Balu aims to create better choice for you, the consumer, by sharing great brands and products that you may otherwise not hear about.
               Ultimately, the choice is yours - as is the responsibility.</p>
            <p>The big brands that command the marketing - the ones that float to the top of every internet search or take prime spot on the supermarket shelves -
                are very often not the brands putting the most effort into improving their industries. On the flip side, there are thousands of small organisations -
                social enterprises, charities, companies - that genuinely go the extra mile. We think it's only fair they get a look in on our purchasing decisions.</p>
            <p>So how do we choose which ones make it into Balu? Well, mostly <i>we</i> don't. As a member of the Balu community, you can tell us about your own favourite brands. You suggest
                a brand or product, we add it to the Balu database, and then other Balu users will see it while they shop.</p>
            <p>Balu is about the small, the revolutionary, the transformational. Like the social enterprise that donates all its profits to scholarships for the children of its overseas
                workforce; or the company that makes products out of waste plastic recovered from our oceans. These are the products you don't often see side-by-side
                with the global brands. These are the products that Balu wants to promote.</p>
            <p>It's not always easy to identify the amazing from the awful, the strivers from the lazy. Here at Balu we are <i>always</i> open to feedback.</p>
            <p>Ultimatley, the decision lies with us as consumers. We must buy whatever product we think is best. Hopefully Balu can make it that little bit easier for us.</p>
